                            <h3>From the New York Times bestselling authors of Sprint comes a simple
                                4-step system for improving focus, finding greater joy in your work,
                                and getting more out of every day.<br><br>
                                "A charming manifesto—as well as an intrepid do-it-yourself guide to building
                                smart habits that stick. If you want to achieve more (without going nuts), read

                            <p>Nobody ever looked at an empty calendar and said, <u>"The best way to spend this time is by cramming
                                it full of meetings!"</u> or got to work in the morning and thought, Today I'll spend hours on Facebook!
                                Yet that's exactly what we do. Why?<br><br>
                            In a world where information refreshes endlessly and the workday feels like a race to react to other
                            people's priorities faster, frazzled and distracted has become our default position. But what if the
                            exhaustion of constant busyness wasn't mandatory? What if you could step off the hamster wheel and start
                            taking control of your time and attention? That's what this book is about.</p>

                            <p>Make Time isn't about productivity, or checking off more to-dos. Nor does it propose unrealistic solutions like
                                throwing out your smartphone or swearing off social media. Making time isn't about radically overhauling your lifestyle;
                                it's about making small shifts in your environment to <b><em>liberate yourself from constant busyness and distraction.</em></b><br>
                                A must-read for anyone who has ever thought, <br><q>If only there were more hours in the day..., Make Time will help you stop passively reacting
                                to the demands of the modern world and start intentionally making time for the things that matter.</q></p>
